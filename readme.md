# Lox

## Introduction

This is my attempt at implementing a tree-walker interpreter for the Lox
Programming Language using Rust! I originally wanted to write this using only
C, but my lack of experience on manual memory management and low level
languages demotivated me in continuing to pursue this path. You can still find
the source code [here](https://github.com/brymer-meneses/Lox/tree/main).

This project is the result of reading through the first part of this amazing book: 
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). 

At first, I wanted to code along with the book using Java, but as I read through it, I found 
myself mindlessly copying code without understanding anything, so I decided to
use another programming language to follow the book.


## Building

To build this application, you will need to [install](https://rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) the Rust Toolchain.
Then, clone this repo, ensure you're on the root-directory of this project, and run the following command.

```
cargo run
```
